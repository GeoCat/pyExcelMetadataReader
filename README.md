# General

Generic script for importing excel data into iso 19115 and 191110 

* xls2iso

Scripts use python3 and it better to have pip3 installed for package installation (management)

Mac install: (http://itsevans.com/install-pip-osx/)

Linux install: `apt install python3-pip`

Windows: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24285508/how-to-use-pip-with-python-3-4-on-windows)


On the folder or each script the necessary python packages are in the `requirements.txt` file to install them:
```
pip3 -r requirements.txt
```
